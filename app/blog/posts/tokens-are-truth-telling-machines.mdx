summary: 'Tokens as truth seeking markets for information.'

Internet made everything transparent. Every little thing with entertainment value is turned into snackable content for the rest of us to consume. In a way, it also exposes a lot of things wrong with our society. I always think of the internet as this living breathing thing that can react to the wrong doings in the world and fight back as this digital hive. 

This notion of transparency and truth seeking is also seen with free markets where eventually (with corrections) — it eliminates the institutions that produce little to no value into oblivion while keeping this nuanced competitive balance between the ones that succeed. This is assuming that there's no bailouts. Free markets keeps things efficient. 

The combination of both the internet and markets forecasted on the internet created this truth seeking environment for the best projects, narratives, ideas and people to win. The people that produce the best content win the most influence. The projects that produce the most value earn the most revenue. The people that produce the best ideas win the most power socially. It’s remarkable at rewarding those with merit. 

I think that crypto takes this two steps further. With the advent of tokens, any piece of information and data on the internet can be turned into a capital market. This gives the strength of every piece of content a measurable dollar value, like a stock. As we move into a period of both AI generated and user generated content, this notion of turning everything into a capital market is actually a good thing since it makes public belief transparent and measurable. 

I used to think not everything should be represented by a token but as time went by, I think it's not a bad idea to represent information as a token with varying characteristics since it’s such a powerful function for determining  truthful sentiment of a group of people. It leaves no room for assumption. The default state for content platforms will be explicit information markets since they’re inherently truth seeking and transparent especially when there’s a never ending stream of propaganda and bad actors.
