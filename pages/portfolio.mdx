## Facebook

I’m currently working as a Design Lead for Facebook’s Ads and Business Design
System. My team and I create and maintain the visual language and web React
components that power Facebook’s Ads and Business products, serving millions of
Facebook Ads customers and thousands of Facebook engineers and designers.

In late 2018–early 2019, our team worked closely with Facebook’s primary
revenue-impacting product, Ads Manager, to help them
[redesign the product](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/improving-ads-manager-and-business-manager)
in the pursuit of increased advertiser efficiency and customer value. This work
was the first result of a coordinated effort to create a more cohesive
advertising and marketing experience across all of Facebook’s business tools.
More about this work can be found on the
[Facebook Business website](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/DesigningBetterAdvertiserExperiences).

In late 2019, I relocated from Menlo Park, California to London, England to help
support the Ads organisation and scale our design system team's portfolio.

Before working on the Ads and Business Design System I worked as a Product
Designer on Facebook's Brand Measurement team, devoting my time to creating new
ways to measure and report ad effectiveness as it pertains to brand advertising.

My first project at Facebook was
[Split Testing](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/optimize-your-ads-with-split-testing?pnref=story),
a tool allowing advertisers to test different ad strategies against one another
to find the most effective way to spend their ad budgets on Facebook.

## Dropbox

During my two and a half years at Dropbox, I worked on numerous projects across
several different teams. Most notably, I worked with the Revenue & Growth team
on redesigning and
[relaunching Dropbox Pro](https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2014/08/introducing-more-powerful-dropbox-pro/)
(now known as Dropbox Plus), an effort which involved both product work (in the
form of building new features, such as password-protected shared links) and
marketing efforts. Additionally, I helped lead the engineering efforts to build
the marketing pages for Dropbox Pro.

After the initial launch of the new offering, our team was poised to grow
adoption. We spent months experimenting with marketing efforts, as well as
refining the checkout experience. We saw a direct and substantial positive
impact on subscriptions through our improvements.

After working on Dropbox Pro, we spun off a small “blue sky” growth team to
explore how we could foster increased adoption of our sharing tools. The most
successful project to emerge from that team was the addition of
[user avatars](https://dribbble.com/shots/1972358-Faceholder) in the Dropbox
Product. Adding user photos to the product led to increased sharing activity,
just as we had hoped, but it also unlocked possibilities for other product teams
to build richer, more user-centric experiences.

In my final year at the company, I joined the Web Infrastructure team as a
Design Engineer to work on Design Systems. I had spent all my tenure at Dropbox
maintaining a suite of design tools, so was able to provide historical knowledge
and engineering principles to address inconsistencies in both the design and
implementation of many product surfaces. The result of my work was
[Scooter](http://dropbox.github.io/scooter/), an open-source (S)CSS framework
and design system adopted by several product teams to speed up their work.

## Side Projects

If the work I do for money is my bread and butter, my side projects are the jam
on top. I routinely embark on new side projects to explore coding opportunities
and design styles outside of my employment.
