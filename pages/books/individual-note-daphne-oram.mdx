Daphne Oram’s essay “An Individual Note of Music, Sound, and Electronics” has
given me a lot to chew on. What starts as a seemingly technical reference on how
humble electrical circuits can be used to produce sound builds up over its
chapters to a chorus of observations about human psychology, our relationships
with music and other stimulus, and how the craft of musicians is enhanced—or
prohibited—by computers.

It’s the kind of book that I grabbed mostly because it looked beautiful and its
title features words I like to see on the covers of books: Music; Sound;
Electronics. It more than satisfies the cover’s premise by explaining, in some
depth, how sounds are produced, augmented, amplified, and encoded by
electronics, and along the way manages to weave in incredible metaphors and
(albeit sometimes dated) observations of human life.
